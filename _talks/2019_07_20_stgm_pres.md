This presentation was given as part of a seminar on functional programming in my Master studies. The topic is the Spineless Tagless G-machine (STGM), an abstract machine that is located at the core of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler GHC. Since its creation at the start of Haskell development in early 1990s it has undergone several significant changes. This work aims providing insight in the workings of the most widely-used Haskell compiler GHC and the STGM as well as showing how the latter has changed since its introduction.
