title: "Virtual Fieldwork in Unreal Engine"
collection: software
excerpt: "An Unreal Engine project for immersive virtual fieldwork, visualizing 3D meshes of photogrammetrically reconstructed seafloor and bathymetry. While possible to be used on a desktop PC, and virtual reality using head-mounted displays (e.g. Oculus Rift, HTC Vive), this project was built for the ARENA2 as a tool for collaborative work in a spatially immersive environment. This tool enables immersive exploration and quantitative measurement of seafloor models using a toolbox for geoscientific sensemaking including determining coordinates, distance and height-measurement, clipping boxes, and strike and dip."
