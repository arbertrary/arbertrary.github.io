        abstract = {The Digital Lab Book is a provenance visualization and management tool for immersive and collaborative cisual analytics.
It acts as a direct companion to the Virtual Fieldwork Unreal Engine application providing a web-application that tracks interaction in the Unreal Engine.
Each interaction in Unreal Engine triggers committing a visualization state to the DLB. The interaction history can be managed similar to a git repository by creating branches and stepping back to previous states in a visualized repository graph. The visualization states can be annotated, and organized in an internal mind-map tool.
The resulting provenance repository can be exported as an archive and imported again, leading to simple shareability and thus better reproducibility of interactive sensemaking workflows.},
