# Abstract

This paper describes the development of a series of four spatially immersive visualization environments featuring dome projection screens, a concept borrowed from digital planetariums and science theatres. We outline the potential offered by domes as an architecture and a mature visualization technology in light of current challenges in marine geosciences. Still though, science visualization in domes has historically been focused on narrative rather than exploratory workflows required by scientific visualization. The lasting advantage proven by all of our spatially immersive setups is their potential to catalyze scientific communication.
