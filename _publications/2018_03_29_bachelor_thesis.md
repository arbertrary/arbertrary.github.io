# Abstract


Movies in their first stage of production are a text based medium. Authors write screenplays that contain information about scenes, action, characters, those characters' dialogue and emotions, and much more. Using text mining methods like sentiment analysis, information can be extracted from these movie scripts about which scenes express sentiment and certain emotions.

On the other hand, finished movies are an audiovisual medium and thus the audio track also contains information about the suspense in movie scenes. One prominent example here are so called jump scares in horror movies, often characterized in part by a large increase in volume after a period of silence.

The hypothesis is that a correlation between the sentiment and emotions of a given scene and the audio of this scene exists. Therefore, particularly emotional or thrilling scenes like action scenes, jump scares or other horror scenes can be identified in movie scripts. These scenes also reflect in the audio track because of certain characteristics like spikes or a continual rise to a crescendo in the volume.

A data set is created consisting of movie scripts, subtitles and movies. The hypothesis is examined by applying sentiment analysis methods to movie scripts and analyzing the audio track of movies. The collected data is then combined to find a correlation between the sentiment and audio of movie scenes.
