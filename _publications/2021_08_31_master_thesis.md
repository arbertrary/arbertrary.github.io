# Abstract

Lexical semantic change detection is an area in the field of natural language processing
that researches the shift in meaning and usage of words over time or over different domains.
Semantic change detection has previously mostly been applied to historic texts, however,
recently data e.g. from social media such as Twitter has been used.
The live-streaming platform Twitch.tv is one of the most popular websites for live
entertainment content, especially in the area of gaming. Live content, often produced
by solo entertainers which are called streamers, is displayed in channels. Each of these
channels has a live chatroom where viewers can post messages. These messages are often
very short, shorter even than e.g. tweets on Twitter and often contain so-called emotes.
These emotes are unique to the platform and different from unicode emojis used e.g. in
messenger applications. A novel text-based data set is created from Twitch chat message
and used in this work.
This thesis reproduces results of previous work in this area and applies these methods
to the novel dataset. It is explored whether one year of data gathered from Twitch.tv chat
messages contains noticeable semantic change and examines that especially the Covid
pandemic has an influence on the meaning of certain words. Additionally, domain-specific
semantic change in the context of two video games is successfully examined. A method
shifting the focus of semantic change detection on Twitch.tv more towards utilizing emotes
is designed and implemented. This method treats chat messages as multimodal data
with emotes as additional modality next to plain text. The results of this experimental
approach could not achieve competitive performance compared to the results provided by
established methods.
